## Teaching
After teaching high school physics in East Africa for one year, I used my teaching experience as a Physics tutor and in the classroom at UC Berkeley. My strength is explaining complex physics concepts to non-technical students. 


**2013 - 2018 *University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA* **
-	Graduate Student Instructor for Astronomy 10, Introduction to Astronomy for non-majors
-	Responsible for teaching recitation sessions and leading telescope labs
-	Tutoring for Introductory Physics for High School - Undergraduate

**2006 *Agape Lutheran Junior Seminary Moshi, Tanzania***
-	Full time high school physics and astronomy teacher to equivalent of 9th grade through 12th grade (in English)
-	Primary physics teacher for ~150 students in boarding school in Tanzania (East Africa) and the only non-local teacher at school
